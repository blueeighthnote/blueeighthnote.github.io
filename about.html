<h1>About page</h1>
<p>This is a about page for BlueEighthNote.</p>

<p>Hi. If you found me, then yes. BlueEighthNote has learned how to program. He also learned how to make a weird website.</p>

<p>I'm just some weird musician that also happens to be a school idol fan. If you don't know what school idol is, don't worry, you don't need to know that.</p>

<p>Interestingly I now study Artificial Intelligence now. Working on a group project. Something may happen, something may not. But hey, it's great to experiment with A.I. for sure.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p><b>AI DAKE NI</b></p>

<p>Again. Don't worry about that. Ai'm just making puns.</p>

<p>...Being an idol fan is weird, man.</p>
